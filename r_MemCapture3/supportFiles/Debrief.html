		In this experiment, we were interested in examining the effect of rewarded stimulus features on your memory for a sequence of characters. 
		During the first part of the experiment, you were trained to associate the presence of either red or green colored targets with a greater reward amount. 
		One of the target colors would reward you with 10 points more frequently than the other color. 
		You were then tasked with remembering sets of three symbols where one of the symbols was occasionally presented in red or green. 
		Although color was irrelevant to the second task, we are evaluating whether your speed and accuracy in remembering those colored symbols is superior as a result of the previous task. 
		This study is relevant to how rewarded features in one context may influence behaviors in a different task where the rewarded feature is no longer relevant.
