	 In this experiment, we were interested in examining the effect of prior familiarity with a person on the recall of surrounding contextual details. In the first part of the experiment, you were familiarized with some of the people by studying their faces or learning their names. Then, you studied these faces, together with completely new (unfamiliar) faces superimposed on scene pictures. We will examine whether memory for context is enhanced for familiar faces and whether knowing the names leads to an additional benefit.
	If you have additional questions about this research, please contact the primary researcher, Melisa Akan at makan2@illinois.edu.
