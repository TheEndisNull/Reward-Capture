	You are being asked to be a participant in a research study about attention, memory, and decision making. In this study
	you will view a series of stimuli and may be asked to judge those stimuli or to remember them for a subsequent test. These
	stimuli may be objects, pictures, videos, words, or sentences, and you may be asked to make judgments about your ability
	to remember them. Prior to studying these stimuli, you may be given instructions specifying how the test will be carried out.
	You may be asked to interact with research assistants or other participants to work on some of the research tasks. You
	may also be asked to perform and make judgments about simple manual tasks such as moving a mouse to keep a cursor
	within a moving target on the computer screen or pressing buttons in a certain order and/or at a certain speed.
