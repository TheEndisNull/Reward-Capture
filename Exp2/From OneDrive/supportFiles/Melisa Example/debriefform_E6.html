	 In this experiment, we were interested in examining the effect of prior familiarity with a person and knowledge of their name on later recognition memory. 
	 In the first part of the experiment, you were familiarized with some of the people by learning their names.
	 Then, you studied the faces of some of these people, together with completely new (unfamiliar) faces.
	 At test, you were asked to identify the criminals. 
	 We will compare the ability to identify familiar criminals with the ability to identify unfamiliar criminals.
	 This study is relevant to how eyewitnesses select suspects in a lineup--since sometimes they know the suspects ahead of time--and also
	 to very basic questions about how we separate multiple experiences in our mind.
	 
	 If you have additional questions about this research, please contact the primary researcher, Melisa Akan at makan2@illinois.edu. 
	If you are interested in learning more about face recognition memory, the following articles might be interesting to you.
